# CoolGuyVim

Da best simple and minimalistic neovim-focused init.vim in town.

Seriously, though: just my own init.vim especially made for nvim. use at your own risk of self-destruction!

All the credits of the marvelous plugin manager goes to the [PlugVim](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) people! Serisouly. It Rocks.
